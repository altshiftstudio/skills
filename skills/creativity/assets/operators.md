# Creative Operators

## Constraint-Based
- **Inversion**: Flip the problem—ask "What would make this *worse*?" then reverse the insights.
- **Subtraction**: Remove a core element the solution "must" have; what emerges when it's missing?
- **Analogical Mapping**: Port a solved pattern from a different industry/era (e.g., "How would a chef approach this code architecture?").

## Perspective Shifts
- **Time Dilation**: Explore the concept at 10x longer or 10x shorter timescales—what changes?
- **Scale Shift**: Apply the idea to a single user vs. a million users, or to atoms vs. galaxies.
- **Role Reversal**: Swap the actor/audience, producer/consumer, or teacher/learner. What breaks?

## Generative Tension
- **Paradox Embrace**: Force two contradictory requirements to coexist (e.g., "simple yet comprehensive").
- **First Principles**: Strip away all assumptions and rebuild from raw constraints.
- **Worst Idea First**: Generate deliberately bad ideas, then mine them for hidden value.

## Pattern Breaking
- **Random Injection**: Introduce an arbitrary constraint (e.g., "must fit in a tweet" or "no verbs").
- **Etymology Dive**: Trace a key word back to its root meaning—unlock forgotten frames.
- **Medium Swap**: If it's text, imagine it as sound/space/motion. What does the translation reveal?
